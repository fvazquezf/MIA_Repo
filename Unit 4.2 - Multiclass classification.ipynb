    "# Multiclass classification\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a classification problem, many existing machine learning models allow only two classes to be separated, usually referred to as \"positive\" and \"negative\". Positive patterns are commonly those related to what is to be detected, such as disease, alarm, or a type of object in an image. Negative patterns are often characterised by the absence of this characteristic that positive patterns have. To develop an ANN that classifies into two classes, a single neuron is needed in the output layer, with a logarithmic (or similar) sigmoidal transfer function, such that the output of the ANN will be between 0 and 1, and can be interpreted as the ANN's certainty in classifying a pattern as \"positive\". The classification into \"negative\" or \"positive\" is done in a simple way, by applying a threshold which is typically 0.5, although this can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many occasions when a system that is able to classify into more than two classes is desired. A simple example is a system that wants to classify an image according to whether a dog, cat or mouse, or some other type of animal is observed. In this case, you want to develop a 4-class classification system: \"dog\"/\"cat\"/\"mouse\"/\"other\". If an ANN to distinguish between these 3 animals is required, an output neuron for each class is needed, including the \"other\" class (4 output neurons in total).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multiclass classification scheme, as has been done in previous assignments, an encoding called one-hot-encoding is generally used, which is based on obtaining a boolean value for each pattern and each class, in such a way that each boolean value will be equal to 1 if that pattern belongs to that class, and 0 otherwise. When training an ANN with this scheme, each output neuron can be understood as a model specialised in classifying in a given class. In this type of networks, a linear transfer function is usually used in the output layer, whereby negative outputs indicate that a neuron does not classify the pattern into that class (i.e. from the point of view of that class it classifies it as \"negative\"), and positive outputs indicate that a neuron classifies the pattern as that class (i.e. from the point of view of that class it classifies it as \"positive\"). The absolute value of a neuron's output indicates that neuron's confidence in the classification. Finally, the softmax function receives these classification values and transforms them in such a way that they are between 0 and 1, and add up to 1, interpreted as the probability of belonging to each class. The pattern will be classified into the class whose output value is the highest. The softmax function is defined as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "softmax(y^i) = \\frac{e^{y^i}}{\\sum_j{e^{y^j}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y^i$ is the output of the $i$-th neuron. For example, in a 3-class classification problem, if the outputs from the 3 neurons are `[2, 1, 0.2]`, they would classify the inputs as belonging to their respective classes, although the first one with much greater certainty. After applying the softmax function, the respective probabilities will be `[0.65, 0.24, 0.11]`, so the pattern will be classified as the first class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the softmax function converts the real values produced by the output neurons into probability values, so that the more negative a value is (the more certainty of not belonging to that class), the closer it is to 0, and the more positive a value is (the more certainty of belonging to that class), the closer it is to 1. As indicated above, the sum of output probabilities will be equal to 1. Because of this fact, a fourth special class \"other\" is needed in the example above and in any other example where a pattern may not belong to any of the predefined classes.\n",

    "Finally, it is necessary to consider a different scenario when assigning patterns to classes. So far, and in most situations, the classes considered are mutually exclusive, i.e. in the example above, an animal is either a dog, a cat, a mouse, or none of the 3, but it cannot be of several classes at the same time. This is the most common case, but occasionally a problem will have classes that are not mutually exclusive. For example, when classifying animal sounds according to the animal that makes them, it may happen that several animals are mixed in one sound. In these cases, the use of a linear transfer function in the last layer together with the softmax function would not work, since, naturally, the sum of the probabilities of belonging to the classes may be greater than 1 (it may belong to several classes at the same time). For these cases, the scheme that can be used to train ANNs is to use logarithmic sigmoidal transfer functions in the last layer (instead of linear), which give an output between 0 and 1, and not to perform transformation using the softmax function. In this way, the final output of each output neuron is independent of the rest of the output neurons, and more than one can take values close to 1. The output of each neuron would again be interpreted as the probability of belonging to that class, but in this case the sum of the probabilities does not have to be 1 (they are independent). Not applying the softmax function has two advantages: the first, already mentioned, is that it allows classification into non-mutually exclusive classes; the second is that an additional class (\"other\" in the example above) is no longer needed for cases where a set of inputs may not belong to any of the given classes.\n",

A two-column Boolean matrix is redundant—under mutual exclusivity one column is simply the negation of the other—and it can even be internally inconsistent (e.g., both 0 or both 1 in a row). To avoid ambiguity about which column is “positive” and to reuse the binary metrics from the previous assignment, the function rejects the 2-column case and requires either 1 column (binary) or >2 columns (multiclass).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If both matrices have more than 2 columns, the following steps can be followed:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Reserve memory for the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and F-score vectors, with one value per class, initially equal to 0. To do this, the `zeros` function can be used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Iterate for each class, and, if there are patterns in that class, make a call to the `confusionMatrix` function of the previous assignment, passing as vectors the columns corresponding to the class of that iteration of the outputs and targets matrices. Assign the result to the corresponding element of the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and $F_1$ vectors.\n",
    "    - Reserve memory for the confusion matrix.\n",
    "    - Perform a nested loop where both loops iterate over the class indices to fill in each cell of the confusion matrix.\n",
    "  ### Question 4.13 \n",
    "  > 💡 In reality, it is not necessary to reserve memory and use nested loops.  \n",
    "  > This can be implemented in a more elegant and efficient way using a **comprehension**, in a single line of code.  \n",
    "  > As a hint, it may help to first write the nested loop with a one-line body, and then try to convert it into a comprehension."
